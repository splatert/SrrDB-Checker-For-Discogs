## Installation

Install with a userscript manager of your choice.


## Usage
Take a look at a release that's on Discogs. A section should appear under the Discogs release tracklist which will display scene release titles from SrrDB.
You can sort the results by date, size, NFO, and SRS.
You can also read more about a scene release by clicking on their titles which will take you to their page on SrrDB.


## Note
This userscript will be frequently updated in order to keep up with Discogs' constantly changing class names as it requires certain HTML elements to make it work without having to utilize the Discogs API.
Please let me know when this script breaks.
